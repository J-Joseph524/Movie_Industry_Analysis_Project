## INTRODUCTION:
We are presenting our pitch to Microsoft for recommendations on how to choose the best content for TV production to determine what factors lead to success based on our research & analysis.

## OBJECTIVE:
Taking a look at the genres, networks and runtime off Television shows, ranked by vote average and IMDB rating.

## THE DATASET:
• TheMovieDB • IMDB

## SKILLS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE:
The skills used to complete this project consisted of working with Web Scraping, making API calls, and using Python to make visualizations using Pandas.

## WHAT WE POSTED ON GITHUB:
On GitHub we had posted five separate notebooks. One which was consisted of the web scraping code (including a visualization), the others for the codes we used to interact with the API and output two more visualizations, and finally the ReadMe notebook which is a layout of how our project was presented.

## QUESTIONS WE POSED:
1. Does the network that a TV series is on effect its vote average?
2. Does a TV series runtime effect the vote average? 
3. Does the genre of the TV show effect its IMDB rating?

## HOW WE PUT OUR DATA TOGETHER:
First, we gathered a list of 10,000 TV shows from TheMovieDB using the API. Using the TV show ID number, we did an additional API call for the same 10,000 TV shows to retrieve greater details within the data given initially. After we gathered the data, we then selected the top 17 networks that had aired the most shows. Next, we took the vote average for each of the 17 networks. Following that, we compared runtime with vote average to see if there was any correlation between the two. Finally, we compared the TV show’s genre with IMDB rating from web scraping.

## FUTURE/STEPS WE WOULD HAVE DONE
The future steps we would have taken would be comparing the vote average with popularity which would show how popular a TV show is according to TheMovieDB’s popularity rating. We would have also done an analysis of the number of seasons to see if the length of the TV show effected it’s IMDB ratings.

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MICROSOFT
Based on our results from our analysis, we can suggest Microsoft not to worry about Network distribution, type of genre or run time when making TV productions. In conclusion, Microsoft should invest in further pursuing further analysis on whether star actors/actresses would effect the IMDB ratings.
